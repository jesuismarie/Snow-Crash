# 🧊 Snow Crash

> *“This repository contains my personal walkthrough and solutions for the **Snow Crash** security project.”*

---

## Project Overview

**Snow Crash** is a beginner-friendly security challenge designed to teach vulnerability discovery, privilege escalation, and secure coding practices through hands-on Capture the Flag (CTF)-style levels.

**Each level**:
- Starts as user `levelXX`
- Requires finding the password for `flagXX`
- Involves exploiting misconfigurations, binaries, or simple flaws

**This repo includes**:
- Flag passwords for each level
- Step-by-step explanations
- Optional notes or reverse engineering steps
