# 🧊 Snow Crash – Solutions (42 Project)

> *“This repository contains my personal walkthrough and solutions for the **Snow Crash** security project.”*

---

## 📦 Project Overview

**Snow Crash** is a beginner-friendly security challenge designed to teach vulnerability discovery, privilege escalation, and secure coding practices through hands-on Capture the Flag (CTF)-style levels.

🧠 Each level:
- Starts as user `levelXX`
- Requires finding the password for `flagXX`
- Involves exploiting misconfigurations, binaries, or simple flaws

📁 This repo includes:
- 🔐 Flag passwords for each level
- 💡 Step-by-step explanations
- 📄 Optional notes or reverse engineering steps
